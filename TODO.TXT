BUG: Find better multi-parametrics permutation handling implementation than hardcoding it into the main.py.
BUG: Update readme, and make --help and --show-commands do the same thing


FEATURE: Create a command to show a populated template of the prompt given a dataset and prompt.
FEATURE: We need to discern the dataset type: qualitative / quantitative to allow the system to know what kind of GENERAL metrics to use

ANALISIS: Prompts must be the same as the dataset's questionnaire
ANALISIS: Calculate each models 1 row inference


FEATURE: Add to the dataset info a short description of what does each row represent, this can be used for better prompt engineering in masking experiments.
FEATURE: Masking experiments prompts will be dynamically generated. Example: Given this information thats about {dataset short desc of row} and these values: for each col: print key: value. predict what will the {answer_col_key} have.
FEATURE: In masking experiments, we should have the following attributes: --masking_column
