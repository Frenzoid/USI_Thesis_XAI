      "response": "The single best choice is \"internet cafe\". Here's why:\n\n- A \"bar\" is typically a social place where people go to interact with others, not spend hours playing games in isolation.\n- A \"hockey game\" is a spectator event, not a place where one would spend excessive time playing games themselves.\n- An \"internet cafe\" is a place designed for people to use computers and the internet, making it the most likely location for someone to spend too much time playing games.",

      "response": "The single best choice is \"opera house\". The lady's specialized looking glasses and gown suggest she is preparing for a formal event, which is typically associated with an opera house. A train station is more likely for travel, and an arena is more suited for sports or concerts.",

      "response": "The single best choice is \"house\". It makes the most sense because a school would typically have a clear layout and signage to help find specific rooms, while a house, especially a large one, might have a more complex layout where one could easily get lost.",
