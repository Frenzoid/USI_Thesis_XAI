Their stomachs are designed to secrete enzymes that break down cellulose, allowing them to extract nutrients from their diet.\n\nWhile it's possible that a kangaroo might occasionally eat a piece of gum, the fact that it's chewing all the time without eating food suggests that it's not digesting the gum, but rather using its digestive system to break down cellulose in its diet.",
