One of the key changes is the shift in the sleep-wake cycle, also known as the circadian rhythm. During puberty, the body's natural sleep-wake cycle is disrupted, leading to a change in the timing and duration of sleep.\n\nThis change is due to the surge in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the pituitary gland to release more melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep-wake cycles. As a result, the body's natural sleep-wake cycle shifts to a later time, leading to a change in sleep patterns.\n\nThis change is not just a simple shift in the timing of sleep, but also a change in the duration of sleep. During puberty, the body's sleep-wake cycle becomes more fragmented, with shorter periods of deep sleep and more wakefulness. This is a normal part of human development, and it allows the body to adapt to the changing demands of growth and development.\n\nIn summary, the causal relationship between reaching puberty and changing sleep",
