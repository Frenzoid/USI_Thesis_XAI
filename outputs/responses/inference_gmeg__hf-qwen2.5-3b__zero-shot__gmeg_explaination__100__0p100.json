The original spelling \"peirced\" is not a recognized word and has been corrected to \"pierced.\"\n  - **Not annotatable:** NA\n- **Explanation for Not Annotatable:** The original sentence structure and meaning are clear, but the spelling correction is a minor grammatical adjustment that does not significantly alter the meaning or readability of the sentence.
