      "response": "The answer \"fight each other\" is correct because sometimes, when people find a good deal, they may compete with others to secure the item or service, which can lead to arguments or even conflicts.

      "response": "The answer \"hang out at a bar\" is correct because bars are typically indoor establishments where people gather for socializing, drinking, and entertainment.

The other options, such as skateboarding, laughing, going skiing, and watching a film, can all be done outside, although they may also be done indoors.",

      "response": "The answer \"building\" is correct because buildings, in general, provide shelter and warmth, making them a suitable place for a person who is cold and wet to seek refuge. This could be a home, office, shopping mall, or any other type of building. The other options do not directly provide the necessary warmth and shelter to help the person get warm and dry.

      "response": "The question asks about a predicament an animal might choose, and the correct answer is \"fight for life.\" This is because in a life-threatening situation, an animal may choose to fight as a survival instinct to protect itself. Flight is another option, but it is usually the first choice when there is a safe escape route. The other options like 'leave home', 'hunt for food','smell prey', and 'feel pain' are not directly related to a predicament or a life-threatening situation.",

      "response": "The answer, \"obligatory,\" is correct because it means something that is necessary or essential, and therefore, it is not optional. The other options given, while they can also refer to things that are not optional, are more often used to describe things that are required or mandatory in a specific context or situation. For example, \"mandatory\" is often used to refer to rules or regulations, \"required\" is often used to refer to something needed for a job or a task, \"compulsory\" is often used to refer to something that is required by law or rule, and \"selective\" means that not everyone is required to do it, only a select group.",

      "response": "The answer is \"corvette\" because it is a type of warship that is smaller than a destroyer but larger than a patrol boat. Corvettes are designed for high speed and are often used for patrol and escort duties. They are not as large or powerful as a battleship, but they are faster and more agile. A yacht, on the other hand, is a luxury vessel used for recreational purposes, not for military operations. An aircraft carrier is a large warship that carries airplanes or helicopters, not necessarily faster than a battleship.

      "response": "The answer is \"orchestra\" because while a snare drum can be played in various settings, it is most commonly found in an orchestra. In an orchestra, the snare drum is used to provide a rhythmic foundation and to accentuate certain notes. It is not typically the main instrument in a theater setting, but rather one of many instruments that make up the orchestra.

A conference hall is a large room or building designed for meetings, conferences, or other gatherings.

      "response": "The answer, \"building,\" is correct because a playroom is a structure or a part of a building where children can play.

      "response": "The correct answer, \"exposure,\" is the best fit for the question because it refers to the act of coming into contact with something, in this case, the French language.

      "response": "The answer is correct because when litter is tossed from a car, it typically ends up on the roadsides. This is due to the high speed of vehicles, which can easily disperse the litter as they travel along the road. The wind and the movement of the car can cause the litter to be thrown off the vehicle, leaving it on the side of the road rather than at a street corner, in the park, or in the garbage.

      "response": "The answer \"get tired\" is correct because running is a form of physical exercise that requires energy, and as a result, a person would typically feel tired after going for a run.

      "response": "The answer, \"mail order,\" is correct because it refers to a method of selling goods directly to customers without the need for a physical store. This method allows companies to reach a wider customer base, as customers can purchase items from anywhere, and the company can ship the goods directly to the customer's location.

      "response": "The answer, \"meow,\" is correct because it is the sound that a cat makes. Cats cannot sleep all day (they are active during the night), they don't see kings (they are animals, not people), they shed fur (which is a physical characteristic), and while some cats may live many years, this is not a sound they produce.",

      "response": "The answer, \"sadness,\" is correct because the question describes the divorce as amicable but not happy, which suggests a sense of melancholy or sorrow. The other options like bitterness, depression, pain, and anguish, while they can be associated with divorce, do not fit as well given the context provided in the question. Bitterness implies resentment or anger, depression often involves a deep and persistent feeling of sadness or despair, pain suggests physical or emotional suffering, and anguish refers to severe and prolonged mental or emotional suffering. Sadness, however, fits the description of the divorce being amicable but not happy.",
