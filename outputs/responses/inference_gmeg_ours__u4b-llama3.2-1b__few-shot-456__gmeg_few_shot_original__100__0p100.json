This is a more natural and conversational way to start the sentence.\n- The phrase \"so I would wear casual and comfortable clothes\" is a more natural way to express the speaker's intention.

The focus is already on the year and the event, so it's not necessary to include it.\n- \"While\" is used to indicate a contrast or a comparison. In this case, it's used to contrast the focus on touring Canada with the focus on playing concerts in the Northeastern US. The phrase \"while\" is more suitable here because it implies a contrast or a comparison between two things.\n- \"In\" is inserted after \"some\" to complete the correct verbal phrase.",

In this case, it is used to provide a specific number, which is 185 million. The phrase \"around\" is used to indicate a range, which is a more precise way to express this number.\n- The phrase \"flow into the North Sea\" is a prepositional phrase that indicates the direction of the flow of water. In this context, it is used to describe the rivers that flow into the North Sea. The phrase \"into the North Sea\" is a more precise way to describe this direction, as it specifies the location of the North Sea.\n- The phrase \"some highly industrialized areas\" is a descriptive phrase that provides more information about the areas mentioned.
