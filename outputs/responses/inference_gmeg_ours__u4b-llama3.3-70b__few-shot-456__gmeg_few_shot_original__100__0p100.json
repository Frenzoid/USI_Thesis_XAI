It helps to pause the reader slightly before introducing the additional information about the location, making the sentence flow better.\n\n## Step 3: Discuss the effect of the comma on sentence structure.\nThe insertion of the comma after \"trip\" followed by \"and\" introduces a clearer separation between the two clauses, making the sentence structure more conventional and easier to follow. This change enhances the overall clarity and coherence of the sentence, ensuring that the reader can distinguish between the main statement about the last day of the trip and the additional detail about the location.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{It was",
