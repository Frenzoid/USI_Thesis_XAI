It's not grammatically incorrect without the comma, but it improves clarity.\n- **{=>will}**: The revision from \"will\" to \"be\" is incorrect.

So, \"will\" is more appropriate.\n- **{not=>be}**: The revision from \"not be\" to \"be\" is incorrect. The original sentence is saying that modern technology makes daily life not difficult, which is a correct use of \"not be\".
