      "response": "1\n\nReasoning:\nAs a medical doctor, I can tell you that jogging can be stressful on the joints, particularly if the shoes do not provide adequate cushioning. The material at the bottom of the shoes plays a crucial role in absorbing the impact of each step, thereby reducing the stress on the joints. Iron is a hard, rigid metal that does not provide any cushioning, whereas rubber is a softer, more pliable material that can absorb impact. Therefore, it is more likely that the bottom of the shoes are made of rubber, which would help reduce stress on the vital joints when jogging. \n\nThis is a classic example of how the properties of materials can affect the human body, and as a medical doctor, it is essential to consider these factors when evaluating the causes of reduced stress on joints. \n\nIn this case, the correct hypothesis is Hypothesis 2, which states that the bottom of the shoes are made of rubber. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{1}$",
