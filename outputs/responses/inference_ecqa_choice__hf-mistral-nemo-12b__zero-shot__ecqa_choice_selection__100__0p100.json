      "response": "The single best choice based on commonsense reasoning is \"balance\". When you stand up, your body needs to adjust to maintain balance. If you feel like you have to sit right back down, it might be because you're experiencing a balance issue, such as dizziness or instability.

      "response": "The single best choice is \"animal\". Here's why:\n\n- \"Body armor\" and \"kill people\" imply human targets, which doesn't fit with the context of seeking lunch.\n- \"Ungulate\" is a type of hoofed mammal, which could be a potential lunch target.\n- \"Bomber\" is a type of aircraft, which doesn't make sense as a lunch target.\n- \"Animal\" is a broader term that encompasses \"ungulate\" and other potential lunch targets.",

This option most clearly conveys that George remained in his current position to avoid being killed, as moving would have put him in danger. The other options, while related, are not as precise or natural in this context:\n\n- \"Not die\" is too general and doesn't convey the action George took.\n- \"Lay still\", \"stationary\", and \"be still\" are too passive and don't imply the effort George put in to avoid moving.",
