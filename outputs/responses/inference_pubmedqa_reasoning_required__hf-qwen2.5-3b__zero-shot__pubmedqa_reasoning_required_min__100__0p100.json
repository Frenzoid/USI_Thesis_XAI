The efficacy of RPS has been previously studied but mostly with respect to squamous lesions; in fact, there has been no study so far specifically looking at the sensitivity of RPS for detecting glandular cell abnormalities. A total of 80,565 Papanicolaou (Pap) smears underwent RPS during a 25-month period. A sample was designated as \"review for abnormality\" (R) if any abnormal cells (at the threshold of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance/atypical glandular cells [AGC]) were thought to be present or was designated as negative (N) if none were detected. Each sample then underwent full screening (FS) and was designated as either R or N and also given a cytologic interpretation. The final cytologic interpretation was a glandular cell abnormality (\u2265AGC) in 107 samples (0.13%); 39 of these (36.4%) were flagged as R on RPS. Twenty-four patients (33.8%) out of 71 who had histologic follow-up were found to harbor a high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion or carcinoma; 13 of those 24 Pap smears (54.2%) had been flagged as R on RPS.

Therefore we performed this case control study to estimate the real risk for bleeding complications of these patients. Between 05/95 and 07/98, ten patients with WD (eight males, two females) underwent cardiac surgery employing extracorporeal circulation (WD-group). Five of these patients with platelet counts below 80/nl were treated by immunoglobulins preoperatively. Each patient with WD was matched to five patients without WD (no-WD-group) using diagnosis, age, gender, ejection fraction, number of distal anastomosis and body-mass-index as matching criteria. Mean number of platelet counts were significant lower in the WD-group than in the no-WD-group despite a significant increase of platelet counts after immunoglobulin treatment (54/nl-->112/nl, P=0.018).

Retrospective analysis of outcome measures. Patients were divided into three groups (remission, failure and relapse) depending on the late outcome of their treatment as determined at the time of analysis, i.e. 88 months (median) years after surgery. Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment. Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment.

For four patients (7.1 %), SL showed unresectability because of metastases (n = 1), tumor progression (n = 1), or severe cirrhosis in the contralateral lobe (n = 2). An additional five patients did not undergo laparotomy due to disease progression detected on imaging after SL. Exploratory laparotomy for the remaining 47 patients showed 6 (13 %) additional unresectable tumors due to advanced tumor (n = 5) or nodal metastases (n = 1). Consequently, the yield of SL was 7 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 3-17 %), and the accuracy was 27 % (95 % CI, 11-52 %). A biopsy of the contralateral liver was performed for 45 patients who underwent SL, leading to changes in management for 4 patients (17 %) with cirrhosis."

We address the question of whether LITT-induced locoregional disruption of the BBB could possibly allow a locoregional passage of chemotherapeutic agents into brain tissue to treat malignant glioma.STUDY DESIGN/ CD Fischer rats were subject to LITT of the left forebrain. Disruption of the BBB was analyzed using Evans blue and immunohistochemistry (IH). Animals were perfused with paclitaxel, and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was employed to analyze the content of paclitaxel in brain and plasma samples.

Ultrasound, however, was superior to X-ray for dislocation identification (41 correct results using X-ray, 51 correct results using ultrasound). Both findings were not statistically significant after adjustment for multiple testing."

Normothermic normokalemic simultaneous antegrade/retrograde perfusion (NNSP) may improve myocardial perfusion. However, its effects on myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism remain unclear. The present study was to determine whether NNSP improved myocardial oxygenation and energy metabolism of hypertrophied hearts relative to normothermic normokalemic antegrade perfusion (NNAP). Twelve hypertrophied pig hearts underwent a protocol consisting of three 20-minute perfusion episodes (10 minutes NNAP and 10 minutes NNSP in a random order) with each conducted at a different blood flow in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD [100%, 50%, and 20% of its initial control]). Myocardial oxygenation was assessed using near-infrared spectroscopic imaging. Myocardial energy metabolism was monitored using localized phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy. With 100% LAD flow, both NNAP and NNSP maintained myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, phosphocreatine, and inorganic phosphate at normal levels. When LAD flow was reduced to 50% of its control level, NNSP resulted in a small but significant decrease in myocardial oxygenation and phosphocreatine, whereas those measurements did not change significantly during NNAP. With LAD flow further reduced to 20% of its control level, both NNAP and NNSP caused a substantial decrease in myocardial oxygenation, adenosine triphosphate, and phosphocreatine with an increase in inorganic phosphate.

Our objective was to critically assess and discuss various aspects of identifying children with asthma using prescription data.

      "response": "Maybe\n\nThe answer is maybe because the prescription data used by Stock et al. and the KiGGS data provide different estimates of asthma prevalence in children, which suggests that using prescriptions as a proxy for asthma may not be a universally good choice. The prescription data showed higher prevalence rates in infants and a steady decline with age, while the KiGGS data showed much lower prevalence rates, especially in the younger age groups. This discrepancy could be due to various factors, including differences in the diagnostic criteria, the quality of data collection, and the actual prevalence of asthma in the population.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that prescription data can still be a useful tool for identifying children with asthma, especially in populations where asthma is underdiagnosed or not well-reported. It can also be a cost-effective way to monitor trends and identify high-risk groups. Nonetheless, it's crucial to use multiple data sources and methods to validate and refine the estimates of asthma prevalence, especially when making public health decisions or policy recommendations.",

Fifty-two patients with mid or low rectal tumors underwent CRT (external beam radiation plus 5-fluorouracil plus folinic acid).

The 5-year overall survival rate was 60.5%, which is not a particularly high figure, indicating that the treatment is not without risks. The data shows that among the 10 cases with complete response (CR), 8 presented with local recurrence within a short period of 3.7 to 8.8 months. This suggests that while some tumors may be effectively treated with CRT, there is a significant risk of local recurrence, especially in cases of low rectal tumors.\n\nHowever, the data also indicates that among the 39 patients who underwent radical surgery, 7 had local recurrences after CRT plus surgery. This further underscores the complexity of the situation and the need for a cautious approach.\n\nGiven these mixed results, it is not definitively safe to say \"yes\" or \"no\" to the question of whether chemoradiation instead of surgery is safe for mid and low rectal tumors.

This was a cross-sectional study. Sixty-four patients diagnosed with early-stage adhesive capsulitis by a physical therapist or medical practitioner were included in the study. Eight active and 8 passive shoulder movements and visual analog scale pain scores for each movement were recorded prior to and immediately following an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Using the local anesthetic as the reference standard, pain relief of \u226570% for passive external rotation was deemed a positive anesthetic response (PAR). Sixteen participants (25%) demonstrated a PAR. Univariate logistic regression identified that of the proposed identifiers, global loss of passive range of movement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26, P=.03), pain at the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02), and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements (OR=0.23, P=.02) were associated with a PAR.

        "Adhesive capsulitis is often difficult to diagnose in its early stage and to differentiate from other common shoulder disorders. The aim of this study was to validate any or all of the 8 clinical identifiers of early-stage primary/idiopathic adhesive capsulitis established in an earlier Delphi study. This was a cross-sectional study. Sixty-four patients diagnosed with early-stage adhesive capsulitis by a physical therapist or medical practitioner were included in the study. Eight active and 8 passive shoulder movements and visual analog scale pain scores for each movement were recorded prior to and immediately following an intra-articular injection of corticosteroid and local anesthetic. Using the local anesthetic as the reference standard, pain relief of \u226570% for passive external rotation was deemed a positive anesthetic response (PAR). Sixteen participants (25%) demonstrated a PAR. Univariate logistic regression identified that of the proposed identifiers, global loss of passive range of movement (odds ratio [OR]=0.26, P=.03), pain at the end of range of all measured active movements (OR=0.06, P=.02), and global loss of passive glenohumeral movements (OR=0.23, P=.02) were associated with a PAR. Following stepwise removal of the variables, pain at the end of range of all measured active movements remained the only identifier but was associated with reduced odds of a PAR. The lack of a recognized reference standard for diagnosing early-stage adhesive capsulitis remains problematic in all related research."

Additionally, 8.7% of attempts were made with the LMAS inserted in the wrong direction, which is a significant number. Therefore, while the manual was helpful, it did not completely eliminate the need for further training or experience to operate the device effectively.",

        "Does a 4 diagram manual enable laypersons to operate the Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae?",
        "Bystander resuscitation plays an important role in lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme\u00ae (LMAS) in the manikin. An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated. A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 \u00b1 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25)."

      "prompt": "Question: Does SYNTAX score predict in-hospital outcomes in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention?\n\nContext: SYNTAX score (SxS) has been demonstrated to predict long-term outcomes in stable patients with coronary artery disease. But its prognostic value for patients with acute coronary syndrome remains unknown.AIM: To evaluate whether SxS could predict in-hospital outcomes for patients admitted with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) who undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). The study included 538 patients with STEMI who underwent pPCI between January 2010 and December 2012. The patients were divided into two groups: low SxS (<22) and high SxS (>22). The SxS of all patients was calculated from aninitial angiogram and TIMI flow grade of infarct related artery was calculated after pPCI. Left ventricular systolic functions of the patients were evaluated with an echocardiogram in the following week. The rates of reinfarction and mortality during hospitalisation were obtained from the medical records of our hospital. The high SxS group had more no-reflow (41% and 25.1%, p<0.001, respectively), lower ejection fraction (38.2 \u00b1 7.5% and 44.6 \u00b1 8.8%, p<0.001, respectively), and greater rates of re-infarction (9.5% and 7.3%, p = 0.037, respectively) and mortality (0.9% and 0.2%, p = 0.021, respectively) during hospitalisation compared to the low SxS group. On multivariate logistic regression analysis including clinical variables, SxS was an independent predictor of no-reflow (OR 1.081, 95% CI 1.032-1.133, p = 0.001).\n\nAnswer (yes/no/maybe):",
