Density is the amount of mass per unit volume of a substance. In this case, the wood. When you calculate the weight per unit volume, you're essentially finding the density of the wood.\n\nFrom a family perspective, understanding density is important because it helps us make informed decisions about the materials we use in our daily lives.
