In English, a comma is typically used after \"also\" only when it's used as an introductory word, not when it's used as an adverb. So, the revised version removes the comma.\n- The phrase \"when I went to university\" is changed to \"when I was in university\" for better flow and to indicate a longer period of time spent at the university. \"Went to\" suggests a single visit or a brief period, while \"was in\" suggests a longer duration. Additionally, \"a\" is added before \"golf club\" for proper article usage.",
