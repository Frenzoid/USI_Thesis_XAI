In English, we typically do not use a comma after \"also\" when it starts a sentence. Therefore, the revised version removes this unnecessary comma.\n\n2. **Article usage:** The original sentence lacks the indefinite article \"a\" before \"golf club.\" In English, we usually use \"a\" or \"an\" before a singular noun that is not specific or particular. So, the revised version includes \"a\" before \"golf club.\"\n\n3. **Tense consistency:** The original sentence uses \"went\" which is in the past tense, but it would be more consistent to use the past continuous tense \"was\" to describe a state or activity that was ongoing during a specific time in the past. Thus, the revised version changes \"went\" to \"was.\"",
