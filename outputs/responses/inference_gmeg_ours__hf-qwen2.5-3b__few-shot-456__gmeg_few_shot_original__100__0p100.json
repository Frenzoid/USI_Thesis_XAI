However, \"into\" is not typically used with \"accomodation\" in this context. \"Accommodation\" is a noun that refers to the place where one stays, and it is more appropriate to use \"in\" to indicate the location.\n   - **\"accomodation\"** is misspelled.

In this context, \"side\" is not the most appropriate word. \"Tent\" is a noun that refers to a portable shelter, and it is more appropriate to use \"in\" to indicate the location.\n   - **\"side\"** is misspelled.
