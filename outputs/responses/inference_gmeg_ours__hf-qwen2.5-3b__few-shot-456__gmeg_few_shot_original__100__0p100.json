Therefore, \"was in\" is more suitable.\n\n- **\"club\" vs. \"a club\":**\n  - The word \"a\" is used before \"club\" to indicate that the golf club is one of many possible clubs. This is a common usage in English to specify that the club is not the only one of its kind.\n  \n  In this case, \"a golf club\" is more appropriate than just \"golf club\" because it specifies that the author belonged to one of the many golf clubs available at the university.\n\n### Revised Text:\n\"Also, I belonged to a golf club when I was in university in Japan.\"\n\nThis revised version maintains the original meaning while using more appropriate phrasing and grammatical structures.",

However, the phrase \"doesn't\" is followed by a question mark, which is not grammatically correct.

Therefore, the question mark should be replaced with a period.\n- Additionally, the phrase \"doesn't it?\" is a more natural way to ask a question in English, as it is a common way to politely ask for confirmation or to make a statement more polite.

The verb \"lose\" should be in the present perfect tense to indicate a completed action in the past with an effect in the present.\n\n2. **\"promotion / relegation playoff away to Israel\"**:\n   - **\"promotion / relegation playoff\"** is a singular term and should not be preceded by \"an.\" The correct form is \"a promotion / relegation playoff.\"\n   - **\"away to Israel\"** is grammatically correct but can be simplified to \"away to Israel\" without the preposition \"to.\"\n\n### Revised Text:\n\"In the first two years of international competition, Cyprus has managed to lose only one match and a promotion / relegation playoff away to Israel.\"\n\n### Final Revised Text:\n\"In the first two years of international competition, Cyprus has managed to lose only one match and a promotion / relegation playoff away to Israel.\"\n\nThis revised version corrects the grammatical issues and improves the clarity of the sentence.",

The original text uses \"travelling\" as a verb, which is grammatically correct, but the revised text uses \"traveling\" as a present participle, which is also correct and maintains the same meaning.
