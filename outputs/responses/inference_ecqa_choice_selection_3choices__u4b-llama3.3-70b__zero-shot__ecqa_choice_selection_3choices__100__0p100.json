A bookstore might have a steady stream of customers, but it's less likely to be as hectic as a supermarket, especially during peak shopping hours.\n\n## Step 4: Making a decision\nBetween the options provided, a supermarket is more likely to have a hectic environment due to the nature of the business, which involves a wide range of products and potentially a higher volume of customers, especially during sales or holiday seasons.

In contrast, a chicken coop is a more specific and potentially dangerous location for a weasel, as it may be protected by the chickens or other animals.
