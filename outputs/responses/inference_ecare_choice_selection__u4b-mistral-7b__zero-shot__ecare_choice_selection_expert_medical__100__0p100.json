      "response": "1 (Hypothesis 2)\n\nExposure to chemicals can have various effects on the heart, and one such chemical is Amiodarone, a medication used to treat certain types of irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias). Amiodarone can cause side effects such as heart rhythm problems, lung problems, thyroid problems, and liver problems. Therefore, if the patient's heart issues are related to chemical exposure, it is more likely that he was exposed to Amiodarone rather than a toxin, as the symptoms of a toxin exposure can be more varied and severe. However, it is essential to gather more information and perform further investigations to confirm the diagnosis.",

However, the action of playing a piano doesn't require medical knowledge, so I'm making an educated guess based on the scenario. The piano producing music suggests that it was played, either manually or automatically.
