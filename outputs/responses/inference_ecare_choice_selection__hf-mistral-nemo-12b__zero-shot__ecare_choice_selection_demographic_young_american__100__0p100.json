Sloths have evolved to have a slow lifestyle, spending most of their time hanging upside down in trees. This lifestyle requires less muscle mass and energy expenditure compared to more active mammals.\n2. Sloths have a unique digestive system that allows them to conserve energy. They have a multi-chambered stomach that helps them extract as much energy as possible from their food, which is primarily leaves. This slows down their digestive process, further contributing to their slow metabolism.\n3. Sloths have a low body temperature, which is another indicator of a slow metabolism. Their body temperature can vary by as much as 10 degrees Celsius (18 degrees Fahrenheit) depending on their activity level and the ambient temperature.\n\nWhile Hypothesis 2 suggests that numerous metabolic processes generate heat in the body, this is not the primary reason for sloths' slow metabolism.

      "response": "Based on my personal experience and cultural understanding as a young American, I would select Hypothesis 2: They decide to add Chinese language. Here's why:\n\n1. **Diversity and Inclusion**: In the United States, there's a growing emphasis on diversity and inclusion. Adding a new language like Chinese can signal to potential customers that the company is welcoming and inclusive of all cultures.\n\n2. **Growing Chinese-American Population**: The U.S. has the largest Chinese-American population in the world. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of people of Chinese descent in the U.S. has been increasing. Therefore, adding Chinese language could attract more local customers.\n\n3. **Globalization**: Many U.S. companies are global or aspire to be. Adding Chinese language could also attract international customers from China or Chinese-speaking communities around the world.\n\nWhile inviting a lot of people (Hypothesis 1) could potentially attract more customers, it's a more generic approach and doesn't necessarily cater to a specific cultural group or indicate a long-term strategy for customer acquisition. Therefore, I believe Hypothesis 2 is more likely to be effective in attracting more customers.",
