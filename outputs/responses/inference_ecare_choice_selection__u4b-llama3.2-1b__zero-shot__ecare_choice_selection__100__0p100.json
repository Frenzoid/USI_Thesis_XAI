      "response": "Based on the given premise, I would select 0 for Hypothesis 1 and 1 for Hypothesis 2.\n\nExplanation:\nHypothesis 1 is incorrect because it suggests that the fortuneteller's statement directly caused Tom's liver cancer. However, there is no causal relationship between the fortuneteller's statement and Tom's liver cancer. The fortuneteller's statement is a non-causal event, and it is not possible for it to cause Tom's liver cancer.\n\nHypothesis 2 is correct because it suggests that Tom's face was like wax due to the accumulation of toxic substances. This is a plausible causal relationship, as it is possible that Tom's liver cancer was caused by exposure to toxic substances, which accumulated in his body and led to his cancer.",
