Instead, the speaker is correcting the advertisement's representation of something.\n* The revised sentence uses the phrase \"what your advertisement had shown\", which is a subordinate clause, clarifying what the speaker is referring to.

The correct verb form is \"succeeded\", which is the past participle of the verb \"succeed\", meaning to achieve a desired goal or outcome.\n- The phrase \"into labour\" is a common British English phrase, but in this context, it's more idiomatic to use the American English phrase \"into labor\", which is more widely recognized and used in formal writing.",

It's not clear what \"better\" refers to, and it disrupts the flow of the sentence.
