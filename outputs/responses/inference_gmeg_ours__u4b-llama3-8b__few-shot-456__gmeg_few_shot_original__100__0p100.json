The correct verb form is \"succeeded\", which is the past participle of the verb \"succeed\", meaning to achieve a desired goal or outcome.\n- The phrase \"into labour\" is a common British English phrase, but in this context, the correct phrase is \"into labor\", which is the more widely accepted and standard phrase in American English.",

It's not clear what \"better\" refers to, and it disrupts the flow of the sentence.
