The reason for this revision is grammatical.\n\n In the original, the phrase is: \"an address {which} I am going to stay\"\n This is incorrect because \"which\" is a relative pronoun that typically refers to a thing and is used in non-restrictive clauses or to refer to the thing itself. However, in this context, we are talking about a location (the place where the person is going to stay). The correct relative adverb to use for a location is \"where\".\n\n The corrected phrase should be: \"an address where I am going to stay\"\n\n Why?\n - \"where\" is used to indicate a place (location). The address is the place (location) where the person is going to stay.\n - \"which\" would be used if we were referring to the address as a thing (e.g., \"an address which",

However, in the context of performing with other acts, the more common phrasing is \"played with\" (meaning performed as an opening act or on the same bill as). The word \"toured\" would be used if they were the headliner and the other acts were part of the tour, but the structure here is \"played with such acts as...\", which is the standard way to say they performed alongside those bands. Therefore, changing \"toured\" to \"played\" is grammatically and stylistically correct.\n\nRevision 2: {=>,} (meaning a comma was added before \"and Ozma\")\n  - The original sentence had: \"Weezer {=>,} and Ozma\" ->",
